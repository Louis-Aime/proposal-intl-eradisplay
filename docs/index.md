# Mock-up for the eraDisplay proposal for Intl.DateTimeFormat 
This mock-up shows the effect of the proposed eraDisplay option on any date projected to the built-in calendars.

Options fields of interest are hightlighted. The problem occurs in calendars other than "gregory", so please change this calendar and choose "ethiopian Amete Mihret" or "japanese".

Problems with display of "chinese" and "dangi" calendars dates are also demonstrated, but they are not addressed in this proposal.

This mock-up can also demonstrate weaknesses or bugs with CLDR and ICU elements used in javascript Intl.DateTimeFormat object.
